# Scan-to-Database
Clud tuning project which helps to scan and autimatically creates a database fore user.
In this we have a login page then user can go to their home page and select if he/she wants to go for a new databse or an existing one.
Case1:
New databse-
The user will be asked for a database name and password and then will be forwarded to the scanner where by just clicking a picture the picture will be saved to storage and then scanned and after that dat will be extracted from it and pushed into database for user convenience.
Case 2:
Existing database-
User will be asked for the credentials and then have a option to see or edit the database.In editing it can add and delete new enteries too.
